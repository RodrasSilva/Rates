## Rates C Library and App

Project developed in the Computer Systems Programming in ISEL

Developed this project with [Rui](https://github.com/RuiPacas) during my course.


  App using the Rates Library also created in this project, it obtains rates and generates a csv file with that information.
   The app receives in the command line the date intervals, the reference coin and the coin list.
   Example : 

   ``` $ rates 2018-11-26 2018-11-27 EUR USD BRL```
  
    
  The content of the output csv file will be : 
  ```
   EUR,USD,BRL
   2018-11-26,1.1363,4.3808
   2018-11-27,1.1328,4.4011
  ```
